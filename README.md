<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## üí¨ Introduction  

**NOTE:** Im not include the requeriments yet. As a resume: I install P4wnP1 aloa image, im change the repos to debian in order to be able to update and install new packages, finally im install a lot of python3 shit, change boot.ini, etc... ill do a little guide some day.

**P4wnPet** is a Python application designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero W and is closely integrated with the P4wnP1 ALOA framework. Conceptually, it‚Äôs (will be) a "Tamagotchi" with pentest capabilities.

I'm trying to create something similar to the Bashbunny, but I believe that with P4wnP1, Kali, and a bit of creativity, it could become a 'Bashbunny on steroids' (except for the speed during Plug and Pwn, but that can be resolved by adding an external battery to the Pi Zero W). The pet is only for fun.

Currently working features:

- P4wnPet strong core: Plugin manager, Event system and Process Manager. The menu manager i think can be better.. but for now, works "fine".
- 2 example plugins:
  - OLED Waveshare 128x64 display
  - JokerShell, pranks in powershell
- Menu for deploy:
  - P4wnP1 Templates
  - P4wnP1 HIDScript background jobs (Show as processes in process manager)
  - OS SHELL Scripts (Powershell, CMD, etc) (No menu by now, but JokerShell plugin is an example)
  - HID Mouse & Gamepad
  - NMAP Host OS detection and port scan (Only for usb)


Work in progress Features:

- HID Keyboard
- Pet skin system
- OLED Waveshare 128x64 plugin
- Pet sprite and behaviorpattern system
- Usable alert window
- Queue for handle alerts (Message system?)
- Status bar indicators
- Some kind of info panel in right side (overlay carrousel?)
- General settings and utilities (overclock, clear tmp files, etc)



Wishes and ideas:

 - DuckyScript v3 parser
 - Use ALPHA Channel in PNG
 - Some UI for introduce data (related to HID keyboard)
 - Wifi and Bluetooth sections (BlueDucky, Handshake collector, beaconspam)
 - Module to interact with external HW, like:
   - Flash DigiSpark (Or other boards)
   - Handle Proxmark
   - Handle RTL-SDR/Sub GHz
 - Check if its possible make a phisical keylogger dump, cos if you plug a external keyboard to the pi, and plug to a computer, it detects the keyboard...
