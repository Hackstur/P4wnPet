<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## üí¨ Introduction  

**NOTE:** Im not include the requeriments yet. As a resume: I install P4wnP1 aloa image, im change the repos to debian in order to be able to update and install new packages, finally im install a lot of python3 shit.

**P4wnPet** is a Python application designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero W and is closely integrated with the P4wnP1 ALOA framework. Conceptually, it‚Äôs a ‚Äútamagotchi‚Äù with hacking capabilities, enabling users to interact with a virtual pet that can execute various commands through its menu system.

Although still in its early stages, P4wnPet currently focuses on the character's animations, while commands and plugins are under development. Given its experimental nature, P4wnPet is highly flexible, with the design and functionality evolving rapidly as new features and adjustments are added. This playful yet technical project aims to provide both entertainment and potentially useful functionalities through the P4wnP1 ALOA platform.

For today, im focus on develop new ideas or systems for P4wnPet, some of them maybe dont work because im sure it will work in a future.

The things actually work:

- P4wnPet strong core. Module system, Event system and Process Manager. The menu manager i think can be better.. but for now, works "fine".
- P4wnPet menu for deploy P4wnP1 Template with one click.
- P4wnPet menu for deploy HID scripts & devices:
  - P4wnP1 HIDScript
  - OS SHELL Scripts (Powershell, CMD, etc) (No menu by now)
  - HID Mouse & Gamepad (Keyboard WIP)


My prayer list:
- Bluetooth P4wns (Some works on console, like BlueDucky attacks or scan)
- Wifi P4wns.. like bluetooth, works in console, but i have to make a plugin
- Improve get the handshake by deauth attack (actually bettercap goes crazy)
- Better system: Make the app install automatically the service for itself, restart when break, etc.
- Virtual Pet system: Actually the pet its only a sprite walking trough the screen... and i do not want to make a p4wnagotchi (its very slow to start, this project wants to be more like Bashbunny in mind)
- Status Bar: Actually only have the menu button, but i have in mind indicators like smartphones (wifi, bluetooth, etc). 
- Include on this README the projects i look for inspiration or directly pwn their code :D
